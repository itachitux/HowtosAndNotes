### Teamviewer not working
https://forum.manjaro.org/t/teamviewer-installed-from-aur-giving-error-not-ready-please-check-your-connection/44546

I need help please, i have installed teamviewer package from octopi aur repository and after installing when i run it, it doesnt work.
It is not able to connect to internet for some reason.

Package link

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/teamviewer/ 73

I have already tried these commands after searching for a solution on forum but nothing seems to make it work.

systemctl enable teamviewerd
systemctl start teamviewerd
Did you reboot after the enable & start? For me, in both PCs, TV continued to not connect, until iâ€™d rebooted. Though an irritant, it was successful, & has remained good since.
